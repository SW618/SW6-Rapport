Hi Jonna

\medskip \noindent
I am not sure whether or not you receive the invitation, so therefore I am forwarding it to be sure. 

\medskip \noindent
They have really worked hard this semester, and for the first time there are actually things which have been completed. Have actually been very impressed by the students persistence in regard to finishing the product.
