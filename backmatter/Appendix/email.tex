\chapter{E--Mail from a Customer}\label{app:mail}

An English translation of the E-Mail seen on \myref{fig:email}:

Hi Jonna

I am not sure whther or not you receive the invitation, so therefore I am forwarding it to be sure.

They have really worked hard this semester, and for the first time there are actually things which have been completed. Have actually been very impressed by the students relationship with finishing the product.
