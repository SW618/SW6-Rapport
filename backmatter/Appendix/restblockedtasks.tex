   \item[{[}\phigh{]} As a developer I would like GIRAF to user a proper login system, such that privacy laws can be adhered to.]
    \item[{[}\phigh{]} As a guardian, I would like to be able to check the synchronisation status, so I can see if I have unsaved changes, and when I last synchronised.]
   \item[{[}\phigh{]} As a citizen I would like to be able to see how far I have come in my weekly schedule, so I do not have to remember this every time I close the week schedule and open it on a new tablet.]
    \item[{[}\phigh{]}As a user i want my data NOT to be on every device that connects to GIRAF, such that i can have private information that is not shared]
