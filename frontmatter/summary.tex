\section{Project Summary}
Graphical Interface REsources for Autistic Folk (GIRAF) is a tool developed by students at Aalborg University for their bachelor in Software Engineering.
The development is a collaborative effort of several groups made from these students.
The tool, GIRAF, aims to assist those that have Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) by easing them and their caregivers in certain tasks.
This is done by providing a variety of tools through GIRAF.
GIRAF consists of several apps meant to ease some everyday activities by those that have ASD, and help the caregivers facilitate those apps.

For the developers on GIRAF the primary challenge is to successfully cooperate together in the development of a larger system, hence nine groups must work together to improve on the already existing GIRAF.
Each group consists of 3 or 4 students, we manage this using Scrum to organise the cooperative development.
As it happens each group have declared that they also use Scrum, as such the project as a whole is organised by a Scrum of Scrums methodology.
The project has been split into four sprints, each with sprint planning and end meetings as well as a meeting once a week which works as daily scrum for the project.
All groups share a backlog which is maintained by the group who represents Product Owners (PO), this group maintains the primary contact with the customers, alongside the Scrum master group that organise the meetings.

\bigskip \noindent
We had decided that only server management should be an assigned area of work, as such all other groups could freely attempt to solve user stories retaining to any part of GIRAF.
This let to the first sprint mainly being bug and UI fixes that had been revealed at the previous years' user tests, held at the very end of their semester.
At the beginning of the second sprint we decided to focus our efforts.
Realising that spreading out to fix various bugs in all the apps would not get us far, we held a customer meeting and with the information from the customers decided what apps we should focus on.
These apps were Week Schedule, VoiceGame, PictoReader and Launcher which meant offline mode.
While these apps were the focus, we decided to start on a REST API as well.
From our very first meeting with last years developers we had been told that they had tried to implement synchronisation and that it worked, they also mentioned that previous years had tried to do the same, yet never finished.
As it happens their solution did not work, leaving GIRAF with no synchronisation.
This led to our second sprint focusing on PictoSearch, which is involved in most apps, Week Schedule and the Launcher.

\bigskip \noindent
At the beginning of the third sprint our group started to focus on the REST API by producing endpoints.
The goal was not to finish the REST API, but to finish enough endpoints, with a high enough code quality and with guides for next year, such that they could continue developing on the REST API, as it was far too big a task for us to do in a single semester.

With this we were successful, the REST API contains very structured code and numerous guides have been created for next years developers which should help them quickly set up a build environment and understand how far REST development is, and what should be done next.
As for the overall project goals we managed to finish VoiceGame and make it standalone, Week Schedule has seen significant progress satisfying the customers need, however without synchronisation its usefulness is low, the launcher allows offline mode, although after an initial launch technically one is always in offline mode as no web communication is actually used.
PictoReader has not been as successful as the development of other apps and still requires some fixing.

In conclusion we have made significant headway on the REST API and thus by extension synchronisation for GIRAF while also improving some of the already existing apps.
Our effort for the REST API lets the developers that follow of start off with and already established structure, as well as a few endpoints ready to start client-side implementation.
For Week Schedule, Launcher and PictoSearch our improvements led to more stable apps with more quality of life features.
