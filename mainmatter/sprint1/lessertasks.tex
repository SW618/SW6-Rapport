\section{Subsidiary Tasks}\label{lessers1}
As there is bound to be a difference in how comprehensive a solution for a task is, some tasks are solved quickly requiring only few changes.
The tasks for which this applies we will refer to as subsidiary tasks due to their size and impact.
These tasks often also have a low impact, involve no new features, are unlikely to block or be blocked by other tasks and most likely will not produce unforeseen complications.
Primarily their concern is fixing old features, this does not mean that the changes are irrelevant, they still retain a \phigh--priority, the tasks of this kind are merely easier to resolve than their the other tasks we claim.
This section will encapsulate these subsidiary tasks and their solutions.
