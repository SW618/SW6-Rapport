\subsection{Wiki Migration}
Part of our responsibility as the ``Documentation and Wiki'' area of responsibility is to create a new wiki structure that can be used for the GIRAF project on Phabricator.
Additionally the old wiki on Redmine should be migrated to the new wiki on Phabricator. 

Firstly we read the contents of the old wiki, then we decided on what documents to migrate. 
Some documents are not migrated as they related to how to use Redmine. 
Most of the old guides can still provide some utility but may not be up-to date.
The documents we migrated without updating the contents to how we add a disclaimer: ``IMPORTANT: This wiki entry has not been update in 2016''.

We have created a new front page of the wiki, the purpose of this is to provide information and to link to other information on and off the wiki.
The front page contains the following contents: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Actionable Commitments
    \item Guides
    \item Goals
    \item Useful Links
    \item Sprint Dates
    \item Backlog
    \item Groups and Slack Channels
    \item Wordlist
\end{enumerate}
