\section{Sprint Review}\label{s1rev}
This section reviews the completion of the tasks and their related user stories solved throughout sprint 1.
Firstly we will provide a general overview of tasks and the EP estimated in comparison to EP spent, as well as a brief explanation of the discrepencies between the two.

Many of the user stories solved in sprint 1 by our group have low to no effect on the users, as such only two of the changes made are presented for the customer in order to obtain feedback on changes made, these tasks include ``Picto Search - No pictograms until you search '' and ``Picto Search - Reponsive search''.

The remainder of tasks that affects the user experience pertain to smaller quality of life changes to the system, such as the wrench in sequence working as it does in other apps of the system.
The task ``Week Schedule - Scrolling schedule day'' was the only extra task not fully completed, during development it revealed itself to be a larger problem than initially thought.
Lastly this section will discuss the feedback given on the two aforementioned ``Picto Search'' related tasks and an assessment of the ``Week Scheudle'' task.

\subsection{EP Distribution}
\myref{tab:sprint1tasktable} provides an overview of how we have distributed our ressources in the first sprint, in comparison to what was expected.
\input{figures/tables/sprint1tasktable.tex}
The table is split into three sections.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formal Tasks, these are the tasks claimed at sprint planning
    \item Extra Tasks, these are tasks claimed during the sprint as all formal tasks were completed
    \item Informal Tasks, these tasks represent work done which has no user story or task on the project backlog.
\end{itemize}
As the table shows most of the Formal Tasks are overestimated.
The ``Update Dependencies'' related tasks in particular are overestimated as unexpected errors were expected from an initial view of the code as well as version numbers.
The estimations in this sprint were made with barely any knowledge of the code, something now acquired in four different repositories, Picto Search, Week Schedule, Sequence and SequenceViwer.
This knowledge is useful for estimating tasks in the remaining sprints.

The ``Informal Tasks'' section of the table also consumed more time than expected, although unexpected support is expected to be consume less EP in future sprints as more guides are added to the wiki.
Furthermore the issues we have helped resolve in unexpected support should not arise again and were mostly related to issues using the tools in the multiproject like gradle, issues which should by now be gone.

\subsection{Picto Search}
This subsection pertains to the two tasks ``Picto Search - No pictograms until you search '' and ``Picto Search - Reponsive search''.
The changes made in order to resolve these tasks were supposed to be presented for the customer through use, however this did not occur.
As both tasks successfully passed the review process prior to sprint end, they were pushed to master and ready for use.
Each build of the giraf product is dependant on the server as a dependency, between our completion and the customer meeting the server infastructure had been altered, breaking the master and in the process making the product owners unable to show the customers a demo of our work.

In order to still obtain some feedback on the search, we provided the product owners with the screenshots seen in \myref{untilSearch} \& \myref{RSearch}.
In doing so some feedback is obtained, although the changes will have to be presented through a demo for the next customer meeting, as such a more complete description of how the changes are recieved is to be part of sprint 2 review.

In regard to the changes the customers feel that\todo{cant be written til PO provides me with customer feedback}

\subsection{Week Schedule}
This task has proved itself to require more changes than initially thought.
Adding a scroll function to week days creates conflicts with the already developed functionality as currently the user can change the order of pictograms by dragging them.
This happens to be implemented in the same way as scroll is commonly implemented, by holding and dragging.
The week schedule already contains a delete mode for when deleting pictograms from the schedule, similarly an editing mode could be created in order to seperate the scroll and drag functionality into seperate modes.
The default mode, i.e. not delete or edit, would then have the pictograms locked in place, allowing scrolling to occur without draggin pictograms and as such the problem could be solved, although creating an entirely new mode for the week schedule was too lengthy of a task to be solved in time for sprint end.
