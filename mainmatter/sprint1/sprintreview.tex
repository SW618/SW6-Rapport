\section{Sprint Review}\label{s1rev}
This section reviews the completion of the user stories solved throughout sprint 1.
Many of the user stories solved in sprint 1 by our group have low to no effect on the users, as such only two of the changes made are presented for the customer in order to obtain feedback on changes made, these tasks include ``Picto Search - No pictograms until you search '' and ``Picto Search - Reponsive search''.

The remainder of tasks that affects the user experience pertain to smaller quality of life changes to the system, such as the wrench in sequence working as it does in other apps of the system.
The task ``Week Schedule - Scrolling schedule day'' was the only extra task not fully completed, during development it revealed itself to be a larger problem than initially thought.
The remainder of this section will discuss the feedback given on the two aforementioned ``Picto Search'' related tasks and an assessment of the ``Week Scheudle'' task.

\subsection{Picto Search}
This subsection pertains to the two tasks ``Picto Search - No pictograms until you search '' and ``Picto Search - Reponsive search''.
The changes made in order to resolve these tasks were supposed to be presented for the customer through use, however this did not occur.
As both tasks successfully passed the review process prior to sprint end, they were pushed to master and ready for use.
Each build of the giraf product is dependant on the server as a dependency, between our completion and the customer meeting the server infastructure had been altered, breaking the master and in the process making the product owners unable to show the customers a demo of our work.

In order to still obtain some feedback on the search, we provided the product owners with the screenshots seen in \myref{untilSearch} \& \myref{RSearch}.
In doing so some feedback is obtained, although the changes will have to be presented through a demo for the next customer meeting, as such a more complete description of how the changes are recieved is to be part of sprint 2 review.
