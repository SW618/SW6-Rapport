\section{Update Dependencies} 
In the current state of the Giraf project the individual sub-project, which are applications or libraries for Android, uses a series of common libraries made for the Giraf project. 
Their dependencies are not all updated to use the newest version, this might introduce bugs which have already been fixed. 
For this reason the first order of business, should be updating these such that this years Giraf project will start with the fewest issues regarding the dependencies. 
 We have taken three tasks which relates to this, namely upgrading the dependencies of the applications Sequence and the two libraries Sequence-Viewer and Picto Search. 
We took these as they all had the same versions in common to be upgraded, they are: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \texttt{localDB} from version 5.1.2 - 5.1.5 
    \item \texttt{meta-database} from version 3.2.0 - 3.2.3 
    \item \texttt{oasisLib} from version 7.2.0 - 9.0.2 
\end{itemize} 
The first two of these \texttt{localDB} and \texttt{meta-database} only have their patch-number updated, this should indicate a bug-fix or small internal corrections, as such they should not introduce any issues in upgrading. 
 \texttt{localDB} is a library which is used to store information in a local database, most of this data is received when the Giraf Launcher is opened the first time. 
 This is to reduce the inconvenience of having either a slow or no internet connection, however it also introduces some problems regarding keeping the remote database and the local one in sync. 
 \texttt{meta-database} is used to create the \texttt{localDB}, the changes therein does not affect any of the applications we are tasked with upgrading. 
  
\texttt{oasisLib} is the connection from the tablet to the remote database. 
In the upgrade from 7.2.0 to 9.0.2, some of the methods used in the applications and libraries to be upgrades was deprecated, and subsequently removed. 
 One such method is the one which is responsible for loading pictograms. 
All uses of this has to be replaced with the new method of loading pictograms. 
 This now uses a helper, \texttt{pictogramHelper}, which has replaced the methods used directly on the model. 
  
\begin{description} 
    \item[Sequence-Viewer] \hfill \\ 
    The Sequence-Viewer used the model directly to get an image, since this was deprecated when updating \texttt{oasisLib}. 
    This method is used to replace a pictogram in a view after selecting an option from a multiple choice. 
     To resolve this issue the line shown in \myref{lst:dep-sv-prev} were changed to \myref{lst:dep-sv-upd}. 
     \begin{figure} 
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption={Sequence-Viewer with deprecated method call. }, label=lst:dep-sv-prev] 
/* [...] */ 
pictogram.setImage( 
    helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id).getImage()); 
/* [...] */ 
        \end{lstlisting} 
    \end{figure} 
    \begin{figure} 
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption={Sequence-Viewer replacement code. }, label=lst:dep-sv-upd] 
/* [...] */ 
// The helper setImage function no longer acquires the pictogram name and causes null exception error 
// This check for null and queries the name by ID to get name 
if(helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id).getName() == null) { 
    pictogram.setName("pictogram_name"); 
} 
else { 
    pictogram.setName( 
        helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id).getName()); 
} 
helper.pictogramHelper.setImage(pictogram, 
     helper.pictogramHelper.getImage( 
        helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id))); 
/* [...] */ 
        \end{lstlisting} 
    \end{figure} 
    Additionally a null-check have been added to assure that a name, locally, is never set to \texttt{null}, as this can cause issues in other methods which assumes that every pictogram has a name. 
     After resolving these issues the application was tested and it worked as the previous stable version did. 
     \item[Sequence] \hfill \\ 
    After upgrading to the newest versions of the libraries mentioned above Sequence was unable to build. 
     This was caused by the usage of a deprecated method. 
     The solution to this issue was fixed by changing a single line to use the correct replacement for the deprecated method. 
    The previous code is show in \myref{lst:dep-seq-prev}, and the fixed code is shown in \myref{lst:dep-seq-upd}. 
    \begin{figure} 
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption={Sequence with deprecated method call. }, label=lst:dep-seq-prev] 
/* [...] */ 
pictogram.setImageBitmap( 
    helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id).getImage()); 
/* [...] */ 
        \end{lstlisting} 
    \end{figure} 
    \begin{figure} 
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption={Sequence using the replacement code. }, label=lst:dep-seq-upd] 
/* [...] */ 
pictogram.setImageBitmap( 
    helper.pictogramHelper.getImage( 
        helper.pictogramHelper.getById(id))); 
/* [...] */ 
        \end{lstlisting} 
    \end{figure} 
    The line in question is responsible for loading the pictograms from the database into the application. 
     Previously the model had been used directly however in \texttt{oasisLib} 9.0.2 this is unsupported. 
    The method call \texttt{.getById(id)} returns a pictogram object and on that object the \texttt{.getImage()} method is called. 
    The reason for it being unsupported is that the model should not be used directly, but rather the helper should be used. 
    In other words the \texttt{.getImage()} method have been removed from the pictogram model class in \texttt{oasisLib} 9.0.2. 
     After this replacement was made then we informally verified that the application worked identically to the previous version with the old dependences. 
    Then a diff was submitted, approved and landed in the master branch, following the work flow of the multi-project.
