\chapter{Sprint End}
This chapter is split into two sections.
Firstly we present sprint review which focuses on evaluating task solutions as well as our approach to the more intricate tasks for this sprint.
Secondly we present sprint retrospective which focuses on evaluating the work methodology, mostly related to the multi--project while also taking an inward look at what could be improved on in our use of development tools and processes.
