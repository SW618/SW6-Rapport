\section{Something something task T222 or whatever}
When a guardian launches WeekSchedule he is first prompted to select the citizen for which he wishes to edit schedules.
A view consisting of the concerned citizen's schedules is then presented to the guardian.
In this view the guardian can among others delete one or more schedules related to the citizen.
This action is performed by tapping the bin in the upper left corner, followed by tapping scheduels to mark them for deletion.
When the marking is done the guardian must tap the bin again whereby he is prompted with the choice of either completing the delete or canceling the delete.
In the current version of WeekSchedule the cancelation of a delete does not unmark the marked schedules, hereby presenting outdated and confusing feedback to the user.
The same scenario is present in the individual schedules when the guardian wants to delete one or more activities from a given schedule.

%%% The Problem
% - When marking schedules for deletion and the canceling the delete
%   the marking is still present
% - The same goes for activities on a schedule, and is therefore included in the task
% Also what is ugeplan even
% Why should this be changed??

%%% The Solution 
% - Schedules
%   - clear list of marked schedules and notify view
% - Activities
%   - clear list of marked activities by filling with fresh bools
%   - update view
%   - collected in exitDeleteMode()
% Dupclicated code was removed and java docs was updated
