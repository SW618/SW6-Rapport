\section{Something something task T222 or whatever}

%%% The Problem
% - When marking schedules for deletion and the canceling the delete
%   the marking is still present
% - The same goes for activities on a schedule, and is therefore included in the task
% Also what is ugeplan even
% Why should this be changed??

%%% The Solution 
% - Schedules
%   - clear list of marked schedules and notify view
% - Activities
%   - clear list of marked activities by filling with fresh bools
%   - update view
%   - collected in exitDeleteMode()
% Dupclicated code was removed and java docs was updated
