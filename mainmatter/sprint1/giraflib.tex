\section{dk.giraf.lib Breaks the Build}
This section is written in collaboration with SW615F16.

After starting the first task of upgrading dependencies, we realised that we were unable to build any of the libraries in the Giraf project. 
We were able to use the built versions of the libraries placed in Artifactory, to build and run the application themselves. 
Not being able to build any libraries naturally blocks the ability to upgrade them, so this new task of resoving this issue is given the highest priority: \pblocking.

Debugging this issue lead to the conclusion that the source of it was in \texttt{dk.giraf.lib}.
The purpose of \texttt{dk.giraf.lib} is to allow publishing of Giraf librarys to Artifactory, by the build-server.
Thus each developer doesn't have to compile all the dependencies for the application or library they are working on.
