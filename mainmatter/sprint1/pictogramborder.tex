\section{Week Plan - Border Around Pictograms}
User story: ``As a user, I would like to have pictograms shown with a surrounding border, such that they are clearly distinguished from the background.''
This task was taken after the initial planning therefore it has not been given any estimated EP. 
This task was given a \textbf{HIGH}-priority by the product owner. 

In the Week Plan application it can be hard to distinguish between pictrograms and the background.
Mostly pictograms with a white background and the Sundays background, which is white.

To solve this issue a border will be drawn around each pictogram in Week Plan. \todo[inline]{Should we discuss other solutions to this issue, i.e. changing the white background? - Troels }
Currently the pictograms exists a squares, but are rounded with a radius of 10 pixels. \todo[inline]{Skal det forklares hvad en radius er når man rounder billeder? - Troels}
To draw a border, this needs to follow the same path as the rounded pictogram. 
To implement this we add the drawing of this to the \texttt{onDraw}-method of the \texttt{RoundedImageView}-class which renders the pictogram inside the Week Plan application. 
Since the same border will be needed for each pictogram, we use the singleton pattern to make it once and reuse the same object as arguments for the method call which draws the image on the screen. 
We refactor the old code to do the same for the rounded corner. 
\todo[inline]{Should we explain what a singleton is, or assume the reader knows it? - Troels}
This change will also reduce the number of allocations, and can thusly help to reduce the number of garbage collection pauses, which can freeze the system\footnote{\url{http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-tips.html\#ObjectCreation}}. 
Since other methods also uses the \texttt{RoundedImageView}-class, then the singleton should change if called with different dimensions, and thusly requiring a different rounded edge and border. 
In this case the objects should be corrected to fit the new dimensions. 

An example of one of the singletons are shown in \myref{lst:singleton_example}.
These result of these changes are show in \myref{fig:before-after-borders}.

/**

public static Path getDrawPath(RoundedImageView roundedImageView, float cornerRadius, float borderWidth){
    if(drawPath == null)
        drawPath = new Path();
    if(roundedImageView.getHeight() != drawPathHeight) {
        drawPath.reset();
        drawPathHeight = roundedImageView.getHeight();
        RectF rectf = new RectF(borderWidth, borderWidth,
                roundedImageView.getWidth() - borderWidth, roundedImageView.getHeight() - borderWidth);
        drawPath.addRoundRect(rectf, cornerRadius - borderWidth,
                cornerRadius - borderWidth, Path.Direction.CW);
    }
    return drawPath;
}

Implementing and testing these changes took 3 EP.
