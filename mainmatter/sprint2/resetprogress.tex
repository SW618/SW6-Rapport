\subsection{As a Guardian, I would like to be able to clear the progress of a week schedule, such that I can use it for more than one week.}
The PO group created three tasks from this user story which combined would resolve the user story.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A: Remove redo button from citizen
    \item B: Add redo button to guardian UI
    \item C: Implement redo buttons behavior
\end{itemize}
It should be noted that the function of the \enquote{redo} is actually resetting the progress of a weekschedule and has nothing todo with what is commonly thought of as redo.
As can be inferred from the task A and B quite simply moving the button and its functionality from the citizen view to the guardian view solves both task A and task B and thus is how we resolve both tasks.
For task C the the functionality for the button is already implemented, it simply needs altering such that it is not used accidently.
Thusly a dialog box is implemented such that a guardian does not reset the schedule by accident and has to click accept or cancel.
