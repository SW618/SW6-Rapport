\section{Trivial Solutions}
As there is bound to be a difference in how comprehensive a solutition to a user story and its tasks is some solutions are trivial in comparison to others. \kim{rephrase.}
This section will encapsulate the more trivial solutions, and for this sprint it was only a single user story. \kim{What are you implying by saying ``more '' trivial solutions. Is the rest of task in this sprint also trivial? What do you mean by ``it was only a single user story'' what is ``it''? Why not be more direct, at write something along the lines of ``We consider two of the tasks solved in this sprint as trivial, we explain these in the section below.'' }
