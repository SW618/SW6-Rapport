\section{Lesser User Stories}
As there is bound to be a difference in how comprehensive a solution for a user story and its task is, some user stories are solved quite quickly with few changes.
The user stories for which this applies we will refer to as lesser user stories due to their size and impact.
These user stories often also have a low impact and involve no new features, but fixing old features, this does not mean that the changes are irrelevant, they still retain a \phigh--priority, the user stories of this kind are merely easier to resolve than their the other user stories we claim.
This section will encapsulate these lesser user stories and their solutions.
For this sprint we only consider one user story as a lesser user story, namely \userstory{As a Guardian, I would like to be able to clear the progress of a week schedule, such that I can use it for more than one week}
