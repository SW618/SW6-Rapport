\section{Lesser User Stories}
Similarly to its namesake in the sprint one chapter, \myref{lessers1}, this section will encapsulate lesser user stories and their solutions.
For this sprint we only consider one user story as a lesser user story, namely \userstory{As a Guardian, I would like to be able to clear the progress of a week schedule, such that I can use it for more than one week}
