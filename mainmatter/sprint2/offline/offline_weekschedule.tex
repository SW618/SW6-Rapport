\subsection{Changes to Week Schedule}
The first obstacle in making Week Schedule offline capable is to establish some policies about how conflicts between offline uses should be handled.
Because of the goal of the entirety of GIRAF being usable without a connection to the internet, these policies can be adapted to every aspect of GIRAF which involved synchronisation.

\input{mainmatter/sprint2/offline/policy.tex}

\subsubsection{Implementation of Offline Copy}
To implement a mechanism which adheres to the aforementioned policies, we modify the method which is used to save a weekschedule.
In \myref{lst:saveschedule} the changes to \texttt{saveSchedule()} can be seen and consists of an added branch in the if chain from line~\ref{lst:ss_beginchange} to line~\ref{lst:ss_endchange}.
In a scenario where Week Schedule is started in offline mode and the user is trying to save changes to an existing week schedule, the solution is intended to do the following: 
\begin{enumberate*}
\item Make a copy of the original week schedule;
\item Prepend \enquote{Copy} to the title of the changed week schedule; and
\item Save the changed week schedule to the local database.  
\end{enumberate*}

This is implemented by using a boolean to indicate if the week schedule already is a copy for offline saving.
When online~\ref{lst:ss_flagtrue} this boolean is set to true, thus preventing a new call to \texttt{saveSchedule()} from reaching the branch for offline saving; hereby performing a regular save.
Furthermore the user is notified during the offline saving process that the changed week schedule will be saved as a copy.

\begin{lstlisting}[float, floatplacement=h, caption={Method which is called to save a week schedule, \texttt{[...]} denotes omitted code},label={lst:saveschedule}]
public boolean saveSchedule() {
    /* Setup code and check if title is already used */
    [...] 
    if (isNew) {        
        /* Save as a new week schedule */
        [...]        
    } else if(offlineMode() && !offlineModeCopy) { (*@\label{lst:ss_beginchange}@*)
        //If week schedule is launched in offlinemode and this is not an offline copy
        //do the following:
        actionHelper = new ActionHelper(this);

        //Restore the original name and save a copy of the new name
        String tmpName = scheduleName.getText().toString();
        oldSchedule.setName(oldName);
        //then make a copy of the original schedule
        actionHelper.copySchedule(oldSchedule, selectedChild);
        //Go back to the new name and prepend an indication of it being a copy
        scheduleName.setText(tmpName);
        schedule.setName(getString(R.string.offline_copy) + " - " + scheduleName.getText());
        scheduleName.setText(schedule.getName());
        //Set a flag that indicates that the current schedule is a copy i.e. should be saved
        //and show a notify dialog that informs the user of the offline copy
        //when the dialog is dismissed the saveSchedule() is called again
        offlineModeCopy = true;(*@\label{lst:ss_flagtrue}@*)
        notifyDialog = GirafNotifyDialog.newInstance(
                getString(R.string.dialog_offline_copy_title),
                getString(R.string.dialog_offline_copy_message),
                METHOD_OFFLINE_COPY_ID);
        notifyDialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), NOTIFY_DIALOG_TAG);
        return true;(*@\label{lst:ss_endchange}@*)
    } else {
        /* Regular saving i.e. overwrite existing week schedule */
        [...]
    }
} 
\end{lstlisting}
