\subsection{Changes to the launcher}
\label{sub:changes_to_the_launcher}
In the current version of the launcher it is not possible to do anything without internet access let alone use Week Schedule.
This is because of the process which takes place when the launcher is started.
\begin{enumberate}
    \item Setup of the application; this includes graphics and the context
    \item \label{itm:sync} Fetch data from the remote server
    \item Prompt for login
    \item Show the home screen
\end{enumberate}
Since step \ref{itm:sync} requires a connection to the remote server, the launcher halts if no such connection is available, hereby preventing any action or continuation.
While halted the laucher repeatedly tries to connect to the remote database, and will continue when said connection is established.
Moreover the current version of the GIRAF launcher will not allow reverting to step \label{imt:sync}, which implicates that once the fetching of data is done, one can only reach said state again by forcing the launcher to terminate and restart.
This is far from optimal, since GIRAF is meant to replace any existing launcher on a given Android tablet, and forcing the launcher to restart in such a scenario would for most users mean restarting the entire tablet.

One solution which could enable offline mode in the launcher, would be to introduce a \textit{Check if offline, then prompt}--step, which request the user to decide if GIRAF should be started even though a connection to the internet is not available.
