In this chapter we will explain the motivations decisions \kim{I dont quite follow, how can decisions be motivating?}, design and implementations of the REST--API for the GIRAF project. \kim{Be consistent in the kind of dash you use when you write REST--API, in the headline below you use a hyphen.}
First we will explain why a replacement to the current database connection is necessary.
Then we will explain the principles behind REST, and why it can resolve the issues we point out in the current design.
Then the technology stack we use to build the REST--API will be presented.
This is followed by an explaination of which parts of the REST--API we will develop, how we design them, and which will be developed in total.
Lastly we discuss how we test that the REST--API is working, and what future work is needed for it to be incorporated in the Android applications.
\kim{there are some language issues in this section, make sure to read it through and correct them.}
