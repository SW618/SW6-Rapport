In this chapter we will explain the motivations decisions, design and implementations of the REST--API for the GIRAF project.
First we will explain why a replacement to the current database connection is necessary.
Then we will explain the principles behind REST, and why it can resolve the issues we point out in the current design.
Then we will explain the technology stack we use to build the REST--API.
Then we will explain what parts of the REST--API we will develop, how we design them, and which will be developed in total.
And lastly we will discuss how we test that the REST--API is working, and what future work is needed for it to be incorporated in the Android applications.
