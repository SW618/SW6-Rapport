In this chapter we will explain the motivations for our decisions in regards to the design and implementations of the REST API for the GIRAF project.
First we will explain why a replacement for the current database connection is necessary.
Then we will explain the principles behind REST, and why it can resolve the issues we point out in the current design.
Afterwards the technology stack we use to build the REST API will be presented followed by an explanation of which parts of the REST API we will develop and how we design them.
Lastly we discuss how we test that the REST API is working, and what is further required for it to be incorporated in the Android applications.
