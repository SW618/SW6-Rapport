\section{What is wrong currently in GIRAF?} % Everything
It was decided at a multi--group meeting that we would replace the current database connection with a REST--API.
This section will explain the motivation behind developing a REST-API for GIRAF by highlighting some of the issues currently present in GIRAF.

Currently in GIRAF there exist both a remote database, hosted by ITS (AAU IT-Services), and a local database hosted on the device.
When the GIRAF launcher is opened it will download the contents of the remote database into its local database.
The local database is made by the ``meta-database''--library, and the content is downloaded by the ``local-db''--library.

During last semester one of the project groups, SW610F15, attempted to setup SymmetricDS\footnote{More details at: \url{http://www.symmetricds.org/}} to synchronise the remote- and local--databases.
They claim to implement this, however they note some serious problems; since SymmetricDS is a bi-directional database replication tool, used to synchronise row-wise, any deletion on one device will delete on every device.
Additionally GIRAF contains a large number of foreign key constraints which further complicates this issue.
Their prototype for doing this was never enabled in GIRAF because of these issues.
So currently there are only a one way transfer from the remote database to the local database and no transfer the other way.

There are huge issues with the aforementioned solution, most significantly security and synchronisation issues.
Since the customer of the GIRAF project are institutions under Aalborg Municipality, there are rather strict confidentiality and security measures which must be met.
These are encryption of the files, password protection, strict privacy etc., which are part of the ``Persondataloven''\footnote{\url{https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=828}}.
This means that we can not synchronise the entire database to each client which downloads it from the Google Play Store, as this would breach the privacy of our users.
Furthermore the server host will have access to the files which are owned by the other clients, which is not allowed either.
The previous solution additionally required a database user with read/write permissions to be included in the GIRAF Launcher which is in the Google Play Store.
In addition to this, if any new platform were to be adopted, i.e. iOS or a web--interface, they would also have to be directly connected to the database server.

To resolve these issues, we deem it necessary to replace the current solution entirely.
