\section{Add And Remove Applications}
\label{sec:add_and_remove_applications}
In the GIRAF launcher, a guardian must specify which apps should be visible from the home screen.
This is the case for both himself and any citizens in the same institution.
Because of this, when the launcher is started for the first time after installation, no apps are available from the launcher's home screen, regardless of if there actually are any installed GIRAF applications on the device.
This would initially confuse some users, as they had just install multiple GIRAF apps but none showed in the launcher.
To add installed applications to the home screen, the guardian first had to launch the setitngs menu, then navigate to a seperate tab called \enquote{Active Applications}.
Here the guardian finally could choose which apps should be shown on the home screen.
