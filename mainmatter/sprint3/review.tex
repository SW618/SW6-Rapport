\chapter{Sprint End}

\section{Sprint Review}\label{sprintreview3}
This section will review the work we have done for this sprint and discuss what needs more work to be completed.
We took some big tasks this sprint regarding the REST API, and we underestimated how much work is needed in creating these tasks.
We spent a lot more time discussing the design of Week Schedule with the other groups, especially about how to solve the security aspects of GIRAF.
We tried to catch up on the work as we saw we were falling behind, which is why we spent more time than we had for this sprint, as can be seen on \myref{sprint_review3}.
We also had a steep learning curve using all the technologies as described in \todo{TECHSTACK REF}
This learning curve ended up costing a lot of time for us browsing various websites and seeking help from SW615, as they already had experience with the technology.
We did not finish the REST API for Sequence or Week schedule, as the services still need to be implemented, but the rest of the layers, Core and Persistence, are both complete with unit tests and integrations tests, giving us a sense of security in the implementation so far.

We have also completed a user story regarding the addition of apps on the home screen of GIRAF.
The customers were very happy with the result and thought that is was very intuitive, and new guardians would not be in doubt of what to do in order to add more applications to the device.

As we did not finish two of the REST API user stories, we will continue on implementing these in the next and final sprint, but as described above it is only the service layers that are missing, which does seem to be the smallest layer of the 3.

\section{Sprint Retrospective}
This section will be a sprint retrospective separated into two parts, a part for the multi project and one internally in the group.

\subsection*{Multi Project Retrospective}
The multi project is running smoothly now and as such it is minimal what changes we are doing to the process.
It was discussed that people left quickly at the weekly scrums and because of this sometimes when another group had planned to talk with someone, the someone had left the room before they had a chance to do so.
Therefore, we decided that having the scrum master ask if we needed to speak with someone at the scrum meeting would be great such that they do not leave as soon as possible.

One last thing was that the differentials which are uploaded to Phabricator sometimes became too big ~1000 lines of code, which makes it very difficult to review in a reasonable amount of time.
To make it easier to grasp what a differential is about we decided that they should be smaller and removed the rule that a differential had to be a fully completed user story, as long as the changes does not break the application.

\subsection*{Internal Project Retrospective}
This sprint we made sure to have a scrum meeting daily, and we also used the scrum board at these meetings, which had earlier been neglected.
This gave everyone in the group a larger overview of our progress, and even helped us produce more work.
The user stories for this sprint have been more difficult than the other sprints but we are happy with our results.
We used pair programming for every single user story and only worked on the programming assignments when at the university while other tasks like reviewing code or writing for the report was done at home.
This greatly improved the quality of our work and also helped uur productivity because no one was doing nothing at any one time.
Pair programming for the REST API is also especially relevant as the code is more complex than the application code which we have previously written, the design is more thorough and the pair programming aspects brings much more discussion of the design.

We will continue to pair program through sprint 4 and also utilize the daily scrum and scrum board, as we all agree that this is the most succesful sprint yet, even though we did not finish the user stories but the reasoning for this has been explained in \myref{sprintreview3}.

The next part is the last sprint of this project where we will finish the service layers for both the Sequence and WeekSchedule end points.
