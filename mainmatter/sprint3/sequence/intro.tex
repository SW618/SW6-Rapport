\section{Sequence Endpoint}\todo[inline]{stadig en underlig titel for noget der ikke er et endpoint i}\todo[inline]{update class diagrams in according with titlepictogram rename}\todo[inline]{Vi skal bruge mere specifikke referencer end blot til pictogramendpoint, at refere til 9 sider er virkelig ikke overskueligt når vi kan være mere specifikke}
This section will deal with the \userstory{As a developer I would like an endpoint for Sequences, such that I can retrieve them from the GIRAF REST API.} 
The \texttt{Pictogram} endpoint was explained in the previous section and techniques used for \texttt{Sequence} which was also used in \texttt{Pictogram} will not be discussed further in this section.
We did not complete all the layers of the REST API for Sequence in this sprint, and as such this section will only cover the layers Core and Persistence.
First the Core will be presented, followed by the Persistence Layer.
