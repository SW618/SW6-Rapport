\chapter{Introduction}
Autism Spectrum Disorder (\textbf{ASD}) often referred to simply as autism, is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder that affects socialisation, communication and learning.
Treatment focuses on minimising the effects of the disorder in order to improve general 
quality of life as no cure exists.

This project is developed in collaberation between undergradute software students at Aalborg 
University and educational institutions located in Aalborg that all specialise in children 
with ASD.
The goal of the project is to provide these institution with software solutions for their 
caregivers that can aid them in helping those suffering from ASD.
In the collaberation process caretakers from each instution serves as the customer providing 
general knowledge of problem domain as well as requirements for the system.

The project, named GIRAF (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), has been in 
development since it was started by Ulrik Nyman, Associate Professor at the department of 
Computer Science at Aalborg University, in 2011. 
Since then it has served as the bachelor project for software students, making this year its 
sixth iteration of software students.
The goal for the system is to provide a nonprofit and opensource software tool to help 
children suffering from ASD.

A total of 34 software students divided into nine groups will proceed with development of 
GIRAF.
Each group will have to work together in order to ensure the best outcome.
For all included this provides new challenges that have not been present in previous 
experience working on smaller projects in independant group environments.
Furthermore the inherited project already contains a large existing code base, unfamiliar to 
this years developers providing a further set of challenges.
