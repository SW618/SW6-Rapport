\chapter{Structuring the Multi-Project}

At the start of the multi-project all nine groups which are participating in the GIRAF project this year, have to gather knowledge of the project of previous years, and agree on a process for the development.
This is done by reading the different project reports from last years GIRAF projects, and also spending time understanding the current codebase of the GIRAF project.
This chapter presents the process chosen for the project, the development process aswell as other activities regarding the process of the project.
