\subsection*{Workflow}
In this section we introduce the workflow for collaboration in the Giraf project, under Scrum of Scrum. 
Groups take on user stories at the sprint planning meeting, but can also remove or add more during the sprint as needed.
This is a result of task estimation taking place after claiming the user story, which can be problematic, since a group might take too many or too few user stories at the meeting and have to correct it later. 
If the estimation was done before claiming the user stories, then they might not be accurate as it is not certain that the same people who estimate it would end up doing the user story.
Furthermore if every group were to take part in estimating every task it would end up wasting a lot of time. 

We have chosen to include a code review process in this years Giraf project. 
The reason for this is to increase the quality of the code, and its documentation, such as comments and javadocs. 
This can reduce the speed at which code is introduced, but we have deemed it reasonable due to a lot of the code current is hard to understand, and poorly documented. 
Code submitted to code review is called a diff, since it is the difference introduced by these changes relative to the current version. 
The person submitting code to review is responsible for finding suitable reviewers.
Typically one or more people with experience in the application or people who have done similar changes to other applications are asked to review.
A person can refuse to review a diff if they think they are not suited to review it, or the do not have time. 
A review is over once the one submitting the code for review is confident that what they have made is of a certain quality.
This quality is hard to define, and is subjective.
It should be noted that not all changes to the source code repositories strictly must go though the code review process.
Small insignificant changes, such as correcting spelling, or small graphical bug fixes can be pushed directly. 

In \myref{fig:workflow} we have constructed a flow diagram for the conceptual workflow for the Giraf multi-project.
