\subsubsection*{Workflow}
Now that the tools and development method has been presented, we will present how these tools interact with the scrum method we use and also the scrum of scrums.
To do this we will show the workflow on a task from when it is introduced, until the task has been completed and reviewed.
Multiple tasks are ofcourse chosen by each group of the multi-project for each sprint, but it is simpler to explain the workflow using only a single task.
