\subsubsection*{Workflow}
Now that the tools and development method has been presented, we will present how these tools interact with the Scrum method used and also the Scrum of Scrums.
To do this we will show the workflow on a task from when it is introduced till the task is considered completed through use of a flow diagram.
Multiple tasks are chosen by each group of the multi-project for each sprint, but it is simpler to explain the workflow using only a single task.
