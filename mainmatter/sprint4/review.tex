\chapter{Sprint End}
With the conclusion of the fourth sprint our work on GIRAF is officially over.
Following this chapter a more complete overview on the work done throughout the sprints, what still remains to be done as well as our suggestions for how to prioritise work for next sprint is presented.

\section{Sprint Review}
For this sprint we had two primary goals in relation to GIRAF; finish the endpoints, the service layers, for both the Week Schedule and Sequence part of the REST API, and produce documents for the wiki in order to help next years developers get started with the REST API.
The remainder of the sprint was to be spent writing the paper, as this had been neglected in the previous sprint.
The work on the REST API was fairly straight forward despite a few complications with cascade-types.
The REST API for Sequence is now fully operational and ready for client-side implementation allowing for data manipulation and data retrieval through requests to the API.
For Week Schedule on the other hand not all data manipulation methods are available, yet to be implemented is request methods delete for Week Schedule and put for user progress.\todo[inline]{Did ya make the deadline Troels?? -M}
While we spent a slightly more time than estimated on Sequence endpoint than anticipated, bad estimation is not the reason for which Week Schedule was not completed in time.
Our review process took up so much time that we were unable to even spend more time on the Week Schedule endpoint, the review process and its issues are described further in \myref{sec:S4retro}.
As the REST API does not yet affect the users, eventually it will provide synchronisation, the only evaluation of it is from the two REST designated groups.
Our opinion is that the amount of guidelines set, have provided us with a good and easy to hand over code base as well as good endpoint documentation for those who need only use the REST API for client-side implementation.
The ability to hand over the code, and the responsibility of REST API development is further strengthened by the documents we have created for the wiki explaining the workflow and guidelines established for the REST API.
Combined we believe that knowledge required for developing endpoints as well as using endpoints should be acquired far quicker than in our case, as the wiki should help remove the hurdles we ourselves had troubles with.
