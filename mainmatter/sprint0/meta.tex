\chapter{Structuring the Multi-Project}
This sprint is unique as its purpose is to introduce all the groups to the work done throughout the previous years of development, as well as how the development will proceed in the multi-group environment.
Initialising the project entails familiarising oneself with the existing code base, evaluating what organisational tools to use and an introduction to these, migrating data from old tools to new ones and delegation of primary areas of responsibility.
